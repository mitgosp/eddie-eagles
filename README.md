## Dashboard information

This is an interactive dashboard that can be drilled into with more charts being shown as you navigate it. For example if you click on the month of May on the first chart and select ABZ, then all other charts will be adjusted accordingly. 

# Problem statement
Using Skyscanner flight information look into deriving tavel trends and insights about popular travel times throughout the year, as well as most frequented travel destinations. 

# Insights
The first two charts investigate the number of searches per travel destination in Scotland across a given month. We can see that the most popular travel desitination is Edinburgh and an interesting insight is that there is a huge uptick for searches in the month of May. 

We can see that the May trend remained the same during the pandemic years, even though the total amount of searches across all months was much lower for 2020 and 2021.

In the popular search graph we can see that there are not that many family travels, so this is an area which could be investigated further. 

The last graph shows us that on average the number of days before travel for Edinburgh and Inverness is higher than other destinations. For Edinburgh this is likely due to a high demand for flights which means you need to plan ahead to have cheaper availability of tickets. At the same time for Inverness, there is likely to be a low amount of flights or the types of trips taken there might just be planned a long time in advance (visiting Loch Ness for example).
